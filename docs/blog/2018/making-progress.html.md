We had all the intention to write postings here every day documenting our progress.  But planning process, and getting initial code written, took so much time that we're just now able to come up for air and write a posting.

Our accomplishments for the last month were

* Establish featureset goals for the initial release
* Establish an initial backlog of tasks
* Write initial design documentation
