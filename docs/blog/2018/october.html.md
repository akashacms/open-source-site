Well, it's three months since our last posting here.  While developing code over the last three months we learned our initial product ideas simply weren't going to work.  So we went back to the drawing board to develop a new feature list, and a new backlog.  Fortunately we can reuse some of the code developed so far.

The new plan is exciting, and gives us a clear route forward to an initial release.
