As has been par for the course, we're making good progress, and are constantly revising the plans as we learn more.  Every sprint is a learning process showing us more of what this product is about.  The revised feature list is as follows.

1. feature A
1. feature QQy
1. feature 3aaB
1. feature zZyZyaa
1. feature 2

You should see by comparing these features with the list published earlier ([](features.html)) that we're narrowing down on a product.
