This time we're certain to have a list of features to share.  We have implemented our way close to a viable first product, with the following features:

1. feature A
1. feature QQ
1. feature 3
1. feature zZyZy
1. feature 2

Some of these features will sound familiar from the list published in January.  We've been heading in roughly the same direction all along.  We just did not know where the journey would take us.
