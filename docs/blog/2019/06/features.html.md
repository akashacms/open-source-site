Have patience with us dear supporter.  We are nearing a feature-complete state for the first release.

1. feature 1
1. feature QQ2
1. feature 333
1. feature 4zZyZy
1. feature 52

It's not clear now when the first release will happen, but the system does successfully build and install with ease, and is successfully being used by internal testers.
