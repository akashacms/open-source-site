By now you might get the idea we are constantly revising the features, and will never deliver the software.  But isn't this the way all Agile projects work?  That as you go the features and concepts are continuously revised?

In that spirit ignore the feature list shown in [](/blog/2019/01/features.html)

If we were to publish a new feature list we might have to deprecate that list in another month.  So we will refrain from making a specific promise, and will only say that the product will have a resemblance to the features listed last month.  More will be known soonish.
