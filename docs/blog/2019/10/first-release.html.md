We are happy to announce the first public release of Farblefritzer Pro.

Two weeks ago we entered feature freeze so the team could focus on testing.  Over that time we have not found any new bugs, and that we've closed 200 bugs over the last two weeks.  As a result we feel confident making the project available to the public for the first time.

We feel like new parents, anxious to see our baby leave the house for the first time.
